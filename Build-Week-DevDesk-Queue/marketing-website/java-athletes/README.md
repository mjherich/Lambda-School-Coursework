# Project Athletes

A student that completes this project shows that they can:

* Learn to use and implement dependencies, dependency injections, and Java libraries

# Introduction

Take the tightly coupled athletes project and covert it to a more loosely coupled project using interface injections. So go from a rigid program that creates athletes to one of flexibility.

# Instructions

In the java-athletes projects, the initial package is highly, tightly coupled. This makes for difficult modifications and enhancement to the package. Under the solution package, rewrite the code using interface injections. You are already given the Main class for the solution package. The Main class CANNOT be changed. The solutions output will look like
`************`  
`Track Runner`  
`************`  

`************`  
`Hockey Goalie`  
`************`  

`************`  
`Rugby Athlete`  
`************`  

`************`  
`Baseball Athlete`  
`************`  


## Stretch Goal

Add a court interface injection that allows each sport to represent its own court independent of each other and of the athlete created.
