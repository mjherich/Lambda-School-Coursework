Other religions are perfectly capable of inspiring similar acts.<p>Look at all the atrocities committed throughout history in the name of christianity: The imperial conquests of Africa and America were conducted in the name of spreading christianity and with the blessing of the church. American fundamentalists regularly murder abortion doctors in the name of religion. Breivik is a &quot;christian warrior&quot; defending christianity.<p>Second of all, Mormons?<p>&quot;On Sept. 11, 1857, a group of California-bound pioneers camping in southern Utah were murdered by a Mormon militia and its Indian allies. The massacre lasted less than five minutes, but when it was over, 120 men, women and children had been clubbed, stabbed or shot at point-blank range. Their corpses, stripped of clothes and jewelry, were left to be picked apart by wolves and buzzards.&quot;<p>The truth is this: Humans are really not creatures of love. Murder is as natural to us as anything else, and history proves it. Killing is easy. It doesn&#x27;t take much. If there&#x27;s any lesson to be learned from genocides like the Rwanda massacres, civil wars like the breakup of Yugoslavia or the Nazi era, it is that a large proportion of humanity will readily become mass murderers for almost no reason at all.

I went, and protested for my parent, whose debt have now doubled because of the inflation. I showed my anger, I threw rocks, I screamed, we were all pretty angry.<p>But only a very small group of people were actually violent, and you could literally point out who was there for a valid protest and who was just looking for an excuse to fight the police.<p>--<p>Addendum: What you may not understand is that loans in Iceland are \"\"insured\"\". That's good... if you're a bank, but if you're a n individual, it's bad... very bad.<p>It basically means that, in addition to interest, your loan principal increases by the amount of inflation. So if the inflation is 5%, voila, your loan is now 5% higher. Now realize that inflation went as high as 18.6%, which means your 4% interest loan just went up 18.6 + 4 = 22.6% in one year.<p>There are associations currently suing the banks and the govt. to try and make this form of loan illegal.",

		"text": "\nI expected this list to be written by a crappy programmer who didn't know it... but it turns out it isn't.<p>I'll add two items to this list:<p>1. You believe anyone who doesn't write unit tests is a crappy programmer.  (I'm done trying to explain this to carppy programmers- not only are they crappy they think that unit tests make them not crappy, and so they can't concieve of the reason unit tests are bad (and often they are...)   If you want to write unit tests for yourself, that's fine, but if you've ever told someone else that they should write unit tests, you're a crappy programmer.<p>2. You believe in Scrum.  Like global warming, Scrum is a religion... back in the old days, when programmers had to actually program, we used to use the \"\"daily status meeting\"\" as an example of the height of absurdity that pointy-haired-bosses could achieve.  Now crappy programmers think that it makes them less crappy.  (No, it doesn't, it actually means your code is crappy... especially if you think scum is an improvement.)<p>Really.<p>I know I am speaking crazy talk-- at least most programmers under 30 seem to think its crazy talk-- but it isn't.   <p>The reason we have crappy programmers now?  I think its cause they are going to colleges and getting CS degrees.  Back in the \"\"old days\"\" when you had to write code to become a programmer, when you had to learn and you cared about getting things done well, we had to self teach and the learning curve was higher.... nowadays really crappy programmers train crappy programmers by the ten-score at universities who's primary goal is separating fools from their money (and I mean any university other than maybe caltech and MIT this applies to.) and they just teach really crappy programming practics.  Those that can do, you know.<p>Speaking of which, you gotta be poor at math to go to univeristy in the first place-- teach yourself and start working right out of high school, after 4 years you're senior software developer, you're much better than the people who have been taught bad practices at university, and instead of being up to your armpits in debt, you'll have a good job and a great income... and four years later- a8 years into your career and 4 years after your friends got out of college, they might have paid off their student loans but you'll still be making twice what they were. <p>But then, I'm expecting to get pounced on because this is a site full of university grads.  :-)  Sorry, this has been my experience, and I've interviewed a LOT of programmers in my time.<p>In fact, I've found that PhDs in CS are useless, Masters in MS are good for grunt work, if you watch them close but generally shouldnt' be hired, and people with jsut a BS degree can usually be retrained if you can get them focused... if they get a job at a big corp right out of school, though, they are lost forever. (Most of them anyway.)<p>All the really brilliant programmers I've known didn't go to college. (BTW, I did, so I know first hand it was a waste of time.)<p>Anyway.....here's a bonus \"\"how to know you're a crappy programmer\"\":<p>You're a crappy programmer if you think \nwhile (foo)\n{\nstuff \n}<p>is wrong because the curly brace goes on the same line as the while.   Generally ,the sloppy programmers who think they are really productive but produce nothing but shite are adamant about that... the ones who think about what they are writing and are useful, put the brace on the next line.<p>Really should use that as an interview question. \n",

First he'd have to fix a bunch of stupid mistakes like leaving Activation/Blizzard (they are two separate groups that are just own by the same company), and claiming to be working with Disney (what happens when someone at Disney asks who this idiot claiming to be associated with them is.)  Probably, most damming though was his claim to already have funding for a AAA title but still needing an extra $80K overall the numbers just don't add up.  This is a really tight spot if he asks for too much money it is more likely funding will fail or that people will investigate his claims.  Too little money and he doesn't sound credible.<p>Second the game concept was incredibly vague about a game that was supposedly already in production.  Making big vague promises should always be a warning sign of scam.  Conversely when Double Fine did their campaign it was okay that gave gave no details about the game because, 1 it hadn't been started yet, 2 they actually explicitly stated that the game might suck.  Coming up with a real good detailed game concept is actually pretty hard.<p>Next the studio and team wer never shown.  Instead you see one young guy sitting at a desk in a poorly lit room with no windows, and a laptop running some stupid animation on it.  In other videos we walked though real offices with real people with names, and real workstations that actually look like they are in use.<p>These last two are going to be very difficult to fake as they require a reputation, accomplices, and money, which scam artists tend to lack.  Not to say scams are impossible but I think they are going to be harding then people think.",
